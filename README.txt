************** READ ME FILE *********************
NOTE: this game was made to reuse the skills I learnt in the first year of my computer science major. (uploaded on GitHub much later).
To run: 
- run the command "g++ chess.cpp chessPiece.cpp  player.cpp square.cpp -o game" and then "./game". OR
- run "game.exe" file

How to play: 
after opening the game you will be prompted for the names of the players. Afterwards, the chess board will be shown and 
you will be able to select pieces by naming the row number first, followed by the column letter. i.g "d2". 
sequntially, a list of the possible moves of the selected piece will be shown and you can choose the move by inputting it's number. 

How to quit: 
- kill the terminal, OR
- type "q" followed by any number. i.g "q1". and then type "y" to confirm. 

to implement list: 
- Game over screen and an option to play again

to improve: 
- selecting moves (instead of choosing square you can provide a list of all pieces that could be moved )
- quitting mechanics
